# Welcome to the Studio85 code repository

I like to mess about with making machines do things. 
This repo is the companion to the [Studio85](https://www.youtube.com/@jshet) YouTube channel.
If you have questions about something here, maybe take a look there. 
And vice versa. 

Feel free to look around.

## What's here

- Stuff you see on the [Studio85](https://www.youtube.com/@jshet) YouTube channel
- Carpenter, the embedded UI framework for fast movers and deep thinkers (open-source, MicroPython, HTML/CSS, HTMX) 
- Hollywood, the open-source hardware library optimized for learning rates not unit costs
- Machine Shed, the collection of task specific automation tools built using Carpenter and Hollywood
