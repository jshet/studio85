# Welcome to the Studio85 code repository

I like to mess about with making machines do things. 
This repo is the companion to the Studio85 YouTube channel. I should probably put a link here.
If you have questions about something here, maybe take a look there. 
And vice versa. 

Feel free to look around.


## Camera tools (Raspberry Pi HQ Cam)

Tools I'm building and using for making moving pictures and movies using Python and open source stuff.


## Machine tools (Raspberry Pi Pico W)

Tools I'm building and using for making machines move, sometimes cameras.
Minimalist methods for maximizing product solving throughput.

There are (4) primary functional components to simplify:

- precise and accurate rotation
- making things that go round make things go straight
- communication between human and machine
- communication between physical world and machine

Solve those core problems well and a world of automation adventure awaits us.


## Machines as tools

These are a few of the ones I'm excited about:

- peristaltic pump for hydraulic robot arms, food manufacturing, thermal systems, and gardening
- linear slide for shop switch boards, syringe pumps, greenhouse manifolds, timelapse photography, stopmotion videography, microscopy, and distributed automation
- drill unit for off-grid and off-shore applications
- and more...so many more...


## Utilities

Tools I'm building and using for making all the other things I'm building and using easier to build and use.
Almost always automation related.

Gear generators for 3d printing, etc.
